## R CMD check results

Large update:

- Better interface
- Much faster, actually much faster than Python's KernelExplainer()
- Support for parallel computing
- Multidimensional predictions are supported

Plus small stuff

## Checks seem okay

- check(manual = TRUE, cran = TRUE)
- check_win_devel()
- check_rhub()
