# kernelshap 0.1.900 DEVEL

## Major improvements

- The package now supports multidimensional predictions. Hurray!
- Major speed-up of data operations and minimization of calls to the prediction function.
- Besides `matrix`, `data.frames`, and `tibbles`, the package now also accepts `data.tables`.

## User visible changes

- `kernelshap()` is less picky regarding the output structure of `pred_fun()`.
- `kernelshap()` is less picky about the column structure of the background data `bg_X`. It should simply contain the columns of `X` (but can have more or in different order). The old behaviour was to launch an error if `colnames(X) != colnames(bg_X)`.
- The default `m = "auto"` has been changed from `trunc(20 * sqrt(p))` to `max(trunc(20 * sqrt(p)), 5 * p`. This will have an effect for cases where the number of features $p > 16$. The change will imply more robust results for large p.
- There were too many "ks_*()" functions to extract elements of a "kernelshap" object. They are now all deprecated and replaced by `ks_extract(, what = "S")`.
- Added package "MASS" to dependencies, see above.

## Bug fixes

- Depending on $m$ and $p$, the matrix inversion required in the constrained least-squares solution could fail. It is now replaced by `MASS::ginv()`, the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse using `svd()`.
