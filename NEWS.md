# kernelshap 0.1.1 DEVEL

- Added "data.table" package to "Suggests".
- Major speed-up of data operations.
- Major simplification of linear algebra.

## Deprecated 

- There were too many "ks_*()" functions to extract elements of a "kernelshap" object. They are now all deprecated and replaced by `ks_extract(, what = "S")`.

# kernelshap 0.1.0

This is the initial release.
