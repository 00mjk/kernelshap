Description: Multidimensional version of the iterative Kernel SHAP
    algorithm described in Ian Covert and Su-In Lee (2021)
    <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/covert21a>.  SHAP values are
    calculated iteratively until convergence, along with approximate
    standard errors.  The package allows to work with any model that
    provides numeric predictions of dimension one or higher.  Examples
    include linear regression, logistic regression (logit or probability
    scale), other generalized linear models, generalized additive models,
    and neural networks. The package plays well together with
    meta-learning packages like 'caret' or 'mlr3'. Visualizations can be
    done using the R package 'shapviz'.
