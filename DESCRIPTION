Description: Implementation of the model-agnostic Kernel SHAP algorithm by
    Ian Covert and Su-In Lee (2021)
    <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/covert21a>.  Due to its iterative
    nature, also standard errors of the SHAP values are provided.  The
    interface is very general: predictions of linear regressions, logistic
    regressions (logit or probability scale), multi-input neural networks,
    generalized additive models etc. can be decomposed, the only
    requirement is that each prediction is a number.
