Description: Multidimensional version of the iterative Kernel SHAP
    algorithm described in Ian Covert and Su-In Lee (2021)
    <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/covert21a>.  Due to its iterative
    nature, standard errors of the SHAP values are provided and
    convergence is monitored.  The package allows to work with any model
    that provides numeric predictions of dimension one or higher.
    Examples include linear regression, logistic regression (logit or
    probability scale), other generalized linear models, generalized
    additive models, and neural networks. The package plays well together
    with meta-learning packages like 'caret' or 'mlr3'. Visualizations can
    be done using the R package 'shapviz'.
